The data shows city types with dense population generate lower fares per ride on average. We see the fewest number of rides occurring in rural areas, but the average fare collected is above 30 dollars. Urban areas which account for 68.2% of the total rides, average around 25 dollars per ride.

Suburban areas seem like a good city type to target for marketing. They generate high average fares, accounting for nearly one-third of the total fares (30.5%), but only accounting for around one-fourth (26.8%) of the total rides. 

It doesn't seem like the number of drivers has much affect on average fare. Looking at the scatter plot, we can see cities with low driver counts can generate high average fares and generate low average fares. We can see the average number of drivers scale with population density, but that makes sense: Fewer clients means less demand for drivers. I would recommend trying to increase driver count in Suburban cities to increase ride availability since that city type generates high fares.
